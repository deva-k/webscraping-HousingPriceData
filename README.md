# webscraping-HousingPriceData
Scraping of housing price data (House and Appartement) and other relevant information from website Bienici (housing website in France) for 2 cities (Wasquehal and Croix) was done using Selenium and Python. Bokeh was used to visualize the data and create interactive charts.
